planlogging
===========

The planlogging system is an enhanced composition of semantic plan
logging structure for recording the activity of autonomous robots on a
symbolic level.

The project was merged into the more general, more powerful
beliefstate system to find here:
https://www.github.com/code-iai/ros-semrec

The code that was present in this planlogging repository was
integrated into the beliefstate system and is continuously being
improved.
